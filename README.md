### Hi, there ⚡

My name is Thales Macêdo from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been studying React Ecosystem and currently I'm focused on React Native.
In my free time I use to ride bike (🚴),to dive (🤿), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and enjoy parties (🍺).
I encourage you to contribute to my github projects!🌱

Let's code along!

Would you like to find me?
