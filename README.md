### Hi, there ⚡

I'm from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working using Golang, Angular and Nodejs. I already worked using Cobol and Java too.

In my free time I use to ride bike (🚴),to dive (🤿), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and enjoy parties (🍺).
I encourage you to contribute to my github projects!🌱

Let's code along!

Would you like to find me?
